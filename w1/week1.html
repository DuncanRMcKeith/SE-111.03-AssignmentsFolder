        <p>I am a 24 year old former graduate of <b>Eastern Conneticut State University</b> i graduate with a <i>History and Social Science degree.</i> This school and plans to become a software enginer came out of a need for a resonable job market since you cannot find any jobs <u>besides teaching</u> with my former degree. I love all things nerdy and hang out with my friends every week playing DND for over 7 years.</p>
