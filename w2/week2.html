            <p>Hi my Names Duncan McKeith!</p>
            <p>I am 24 your average 24 year old man, with a passion for all things nerdy and fun. I Play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons, video games, and consume whatever medias before me. I grew up in a small town called East Lyme in Conneticut, along the coast so instead of embracing nature I decided to be the kid in the basement playing video games and studying. I know such a cool kid. </p>
